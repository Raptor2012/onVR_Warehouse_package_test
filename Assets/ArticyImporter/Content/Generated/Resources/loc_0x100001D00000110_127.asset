  - "Here in the bone marrow, you\u2019ll see how the FLT3-ITD mutation activates
    early \u2014 right at the source. It drives uncontrolled cell growth and plays
    a key role in the development of AML."
  - "Welcome to this VR prototype. Here, an emotional and immersive story is being
    created that explains the pathology and treatment options of Acute Myeloid Leukemia
    in a way that is easy for anyone to understand\u2014without oversimplifying the
    complexity of the disease."
  - "Look at your hands: you\u2019ll see a small Joystick for your thumb - a thumbstick!
    If you point the controller towards a portal and push the thumbstick forward,
    you will teleport to a new location."
  - Sometimes, I will teleport you directly to another point in the room. This allows
    me to guide you through the environment step by step. I just did that.
  - 'Now we try the portal: remember the thumbstick? Aim at the portal with your
    controller and push the thumbstick forward to aim, let go to jump.'
  - "We are now in the spinal cord. This is where you\u2019ll learn about the burden
    of AML \u2014 and how the FLT3-ITD mutation makes it even more aggressive and
    harder to treat."
  - "Most patients with the FLT3-ITD+ mutation face the worst prognosis \u2014 even
    current guidelines confirm that. As we move through this funnel, built from the
    endpoints of major studies, you\u2019ll see how treatment options narrow\u2026"
  - "\u2026and one conclusion becomes clear: for FLT3-ITD+, there\u2019s a targeted
    answer \u2014 VANFLYTA\xAE. This is where rare mutation meets precision treatment."
  - "Let\u2019s now enter the VANFLYTA Campus, where you\u2019ll explore the therapy
    in detail \u2014 including a factual overview, visualized data sets, and their
    clinical sources."
  - "Welcome to the therapy zone. Here, you\u2019ll explore the mode of action of
    VANFLYTA\xAE, and follow its role across all phases of treatment \u2014 induction,
    consolidation, and maintenance. Watch closely: complete remission triples, and
    overall survival doubles."
  - "You\u2019ve just experienced a first glimpse into this VR prototype \u2014 a
    foundation for something much bigger. The final content will be developed together
    with you, in co-creation workshops, to ensure it truly fits the needs of clinical
    practice.\n\nThank you for taking this journey with us. Please remove your headset
    now \u2014 and we look forward to shaping the next steps together."
  - here you can see some examples of 3D assets that we can integrate into the application.
    designing the actual models will be an essential part of the application.
